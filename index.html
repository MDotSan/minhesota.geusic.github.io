		<h1> Who Am I? </h1>
		<p> I graduated Rutgers in August 2021, with a B.S. in Computer Science.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I was in middle school, my friend showed me how to make a 
			<br>
			<br>
			computer "talk". Ever since then, I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up.
			<br>
			<br>
			This incident became my driving force to learn computer science; now
			<br>
			<br>
			I am currently looking to utilize my 7+ years of experiences and skills
			<br>
			<br>
			in computer science to build softwares and provide solutions to IT problems.
			<br>
			<br>
			I have experiences in Java, C, C#, MySQL, Ocaml, HTML, and CSS. I am still 
			<br>
			<br>
			looking to learn more languages and improve upon my skills. If you are 
			<br>
			<br>
			interested in getting to know more about my expriences, skills, and what else
			<br>
			<br>
			I can offer, please email me.
